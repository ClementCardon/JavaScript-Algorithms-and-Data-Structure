<h1>Sum all numbers in a range</h1>
<h2>Problem explanation</h2>

<p>We have the function sumAll that takes the array arr as a parameter.</p>
<p>The array arr has two numbers as elements.</p>
<p>
  We need to find the sum of those two numbers plus the sum of all the numbers
  between them.
</p>
<p>We also know that the lowest number will not always come first.</p>
<p>We'll create a variable to store the sum of the elements (let sum = 0).</p>
<p>
  We also need to make sure that we have the minimum number (min) and the
  maximum number (max) of the array.
</p>
<p>
  And we'l need to iterate through the array from min to the max to get all
  numbers between and sum them up.
</p>
<p>
  So we'll use a for loop and the i variable will be assigned the minimun number
  of arr using the function Math.min() with the spread operator (...arr) as the
  parameter (let i = Math.min(...arr)).
</p>
<p>
  The spread operator (...) will allow the array to be expanded and so we'll
  have all the numbers between the two elements of arr.
</p>
<p>
  The i variable will be less than the maximum number of arr (i <=
  Math.max(...arr))
</p>
<p>And the i variable will be incremented by 1 in each loop.</p>
<p>After we get the sum we'll return it.</p>
